## Towards a Safety Engine for Robotic Assisted Tele-Surgery

My current research project involves developing a safety engine for robotic tele-surgery that focuses on ensuring the reliability of robotic laparoscopic tele-surgery systems and prioritizing patient safety. Our main objectives are to analyze these systems, construct safety models and engines, and establish an end-to-end hazard detection and recovery architecture.

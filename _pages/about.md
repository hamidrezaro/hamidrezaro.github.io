<br />

I am a PhD student in the computer engineering department, uniersity of Virginia. I am also a researcher in the [Dependable Systems and Analytics (DSA)](https://github.com/UVA-DSA) group working under the supervision of professor [Homa Alemzadeh](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/homa-alemzadeh). Our lab is located in the Link Lab, a world-class center of excellence in cyber-physical systems (CPS). Our group focuses on developing techniques and tools for design and assessment of resilient cyber-physical systems, in particular reliability, safety, and security assurance of medical CPS, surgical robots, and autonomous systems. 

I received by B.Sc in electrical and control engineering from Amirkabir University of technology, where I worked on tele-rehabilitation robotic systems. I am interested in the intersection of health systems and analytics, medical and dependable cyber-physical systems.

I am a PhD student in the computer engineering department, uniersity of Virginia. I am also a researcher in the [Dependable Systems and Analytics (DSA)](https://github.com/UVA-DSA) group working under the supervision of professor [Homa Alemzadeh](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/homa-alemzadeh). Our lab is located in the Link Lab, a research center focusing on cyber physical systems. Our group in particular, focuses on developing techniques and tools for design and assessment of resilient cyber-physical systems (CPS), in particular reliability, safety, and security assurance of medical CPS, surgical robots, and autonomous systems.
